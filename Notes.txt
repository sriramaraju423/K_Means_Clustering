Find optimum k value instead of sqrt(n/2): Which is elbow curve. Basically we look for a massive drop, excluding the initial drop
Total sum of squres is the measure that we get before clustering even starts. Hence this value doesn't change irrespective of no of clusters.
Higher the between ss , the more dispersion is b/w clusters
Choosing optimum k value is so subjective.
