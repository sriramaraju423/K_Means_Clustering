Dendrogram:
Best model: Balance of dengrogram is the only measure that we have.
K-means clustering: First start with predefined clusters, finds distances, reassigns datapoints, and does this until we get final perfect output
In Heirarchical clustering we find distances first, and for cluster to datapoint distances we use linkage function concept and find distance and draw dengrogram
